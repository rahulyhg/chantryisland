			<p class="aboutP">I started my multimedia career in 2011. I created an anti-bullying website with my brother Charlie. The website was called ‘BeingGinge‘. The website was developed to provide a place for redheads to communicate in a safe and monitored online environment about their experiences of bullying. I was not bullied due to my hair colour, however I do know redheads that were constantly bullied, hence, BeingGinge was born.</p>
			<p class="aboutP">BeingGinge grew to hundreds of members from around the world and later became ‘TalkAboutBullies.com’. This was no longer just for redheads. It had 2,100 registered users when it was closed in early 2013.</p>
			<p class="aboutP">I have been doing freelance web development for small businesses through Kijiji, since 2011. In 2013, I was hired as a web developer at Campus Creative. I continued at Campus Creative until January 2016 when I branched out on my own and created <a href="https://www.ginge.ca" target="_blank">Ginge Digital</a>, offering digital marketing services. Running my own company and creating new projects has always been my dream!</p>
			<p class="aboutP">In July 2016 I began employment at DevLift Media as a Web Designer. My goals were to gain valuable experience and to contribute to unique and innovative projects. My plan is to expand Ginge Digital over a period of time while at school and employed at DevLift Media. That’s my story so far, I look forward to what the future has in store for me! :)</p>
